Description
===========
UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed
in .zip format (also called "zipfiles"). Although highly compatible both
with PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's
own Zip program, our primary objectives have been portability and
non-MSDOS functionality.
